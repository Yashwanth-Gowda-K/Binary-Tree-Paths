# Binary-Tree-Paths

This project solves the problem of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree and returning them as formatted strings. The solution demonstrates efficient tree traversal techniques and proper path construction. A great exercise for understanding recursive tree algorithms and string manipulation in Python.
